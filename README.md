# To Do:
* introduce concurrency via worker pool for shelling out
  * how to balance load, what to do when high load makes me run out of workers
* caching
  * how to have workers access it.
* package structure
  * where to place models? (unit of reuse for golang, should be ~= to a Java class)
  * see [this article](https://medium.com/@benbjohnson/standard-package-layout-7cdbc8391fc1)
* make a presentation using [go present](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/present)
* look at [Akshay's Makefile](https://github.com/akshayjshah/dotfiles/blob/master/Makefile#L8)
